# KT00272 maximal KL uncertainty report

Original PC SHA-256: `4ea70ce2df9e84eec9774ddfce003de3d77e083df2c9664d359a0fed076f70eb`  
KL SHA-256: `1d32f6d828ab3a1ab566fef32e1479c8536f6d8a88342fb40c2003cf24ee45eb`  
Strict source completeness: **no**.  
This KL is a reconstruction candidate. Compilation does not establish original behavior or deployment safety.

## Coverage

- Statements from existing source-safe renderer: 1
- Additional unproved statements emitted as code: 2 (66.67% of emitted statements)
- Existing-renderer statements with explicitly unproved rules: 2
- Guarded compact STRING concat source spellings (unproved original spelling): 0
- Remaining unresolved PC spans in comments: 0
- Remaining unsafe source expressions in comments: 0
- Explanatory comments moved to JSON report: 14
- Blank layout lines removed: 3
- Original routine declaration blockers: 0
- Routine declaration warnings in comments: 0
- Unknown compact 2C cells: 0 (0 directly referenced)
- Exact direct sites to unknown cells: 0
- Routines without located compact-cell geometry: 0
- Unknown compact cells without known frame offsets: 0
- WIP compact type choices: {}

## Unproved rendering methods used

- `bounded_indexed_short_array_transfer`: 2 statements
- `implicit_integer_real_expression`: 1 statements

The companion JSON lists every emitted unproved statement, remaining comment,
unknown-cell alternative, and original-PC local-reference site with code offset.
Source-safe here means accepted by the maintained renderer; it does not mean
the original source spelling or whole-PC equality has been recovered.
