# CE0075 maximal KL uncertainty report

Original PC SHA-256: `abaea794849040114c6f45ea7c8526eb2e60ca536e3685cb12e7b2ddff232ece`  
KL SHA-256: `13d9458d52b49b94c6dce94718cac0d3f84fe5c9643fe4ddb69a5001f071cd4c`  
Strict source completeness: **no**.  
This KL is a reconstruction candidate. Compilation does not establish original behavior or deployment safety.

## Coverage

- Statements from existing source-safe renderer: 8
- Additional unproved statements emitted as code: 7 (46.67% of emitted statements)
- Existing-renderer statements with explicitly unproved rules: 2
- Guarded compact STRING concat source spellings (unproved original spelling): 0
- Remaining unresolved PC spans in comments: 2
- Remaining unsafe source expressions in comments: 0
- Explanatory comments moved to JSON report: 25
- Blank layout lines removed: 8
- Original routine declaration blockers: 1
- Routine declaration warnings in comments: 0
- Unknown compact 2C cells: 5 (5 directly referenced)
- Exact direct sites to unknown cells: 7
- Routines without located compact-cell geometry: 0
- Unknown compact cells without known frame offsets: 0
- WIP compact type choices: {'BOOLEAN': 2, 'INTEGER': 3}

## Unproved rendering methods used

- `assumed_compact_2c_source_type`: 5 statements
- `bounded_scalar_expression_return`: 2 statements

The companion JSON lists every emitted unproved statement, remaining comment,
unknown-cell alternative, and original-PC local-reference site with code offset.
Source-safe here means accepted by the maintained renderer; it does not mean
the original source spelling or whole-PC equality has been recovered.
