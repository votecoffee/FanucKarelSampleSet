# CE0142 maximal KL uncertainty report

Original PC SHA-256: `7f916f5f00cdde8566de7e168ff0b8db9b3d0757e7a59d1ea1fa3f21c8f4f1e6`  
KL SHA-256: `b4873c1ceed6634aa80ea9b0b42b7d6419ea096e094e7b9ba9eefab8bdacebfa`  
Strict source completeness: **no**.  
This KL is a reconstruction candidate. Compilation does not establish original behavior or deployment safety.

## Coverage

- Statements from existing source-safe renderer: 8
- Additional unproved statements emitted as code: 8 (50.00% of emitted statements)
- Existing-renderer statements with explicitly unproved rules: 2
- Guarded compact STRING concat source spellings (unproved original spelling): 0
- Remaining unresolved PC spans in comments: 1
- Remaining unsafe source expressions in comments: 0
- Explanatory comments moved to JSON report: 25
- Blank layout lines removed: 8
- Original routine declaration blockers: 1
- Routine declaration warnings in comments: 0
- Unknown compact 2C cells: 5 (5 directly referenced)
- Exact direct sites to unknown cells: 7
- Routines without located compact-cell geometry: 0
- Unknown compact cells without known frame offsets: 0
- WIP compact type choices: {'INTEGER': 3, 'REAL': 2}

## Unproved rendering methods used

- `assumed_compact_2c_source_type`: 6 statements
- `bounded_scalar_expression_return`: 2 statements

The companion JSON lists every emitted unproved statement, remaining comment,
unknown-cell alternative, and original-PC local-reference site with code offset.
Source-safe here means accepted by the maintained renderer; it does not mean
the original source spelling or whole-PC equality has been recovered.

## Source-marker layout

- Compiler comparison: whole_pc_equal; original source text is not authenticated.
- Filler decisions and validation: `C:\~LocalWork\Repos\Programming\~Github\KarelPCDecompileSampleSet\Karel Feature Set\PC\V8.33\Decompiled\Probes4\Conditions\CE0142\marker_fit\marker_fit.json`
