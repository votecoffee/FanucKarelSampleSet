# CA0070 maximal KL uncertainty report

Original PC SHA-256: `49a5df0b6ed85952509f4c2680a9395d0af3fb841929af5e4b3f8dbb215becf8`  
KL SHA-256: `2178f889b428a1d42af02c11d9515e3d362b068467bc73f2939e338019e96f1a`  
Strict source completeness: **no**.  
This KL is a reconstruction candidate. Compilation does not establish original behavior or deployment safety.

## Coverage

- Statements from existing source-safe renderer: 8
- Additional unproved statements emitted as code: 0 (0.00% of emitted statements)
- Existing-renderer statements with explicitly unproved rules: 2
- Guarded compact STRING concat source spellings (unproved original spelling): 0
- Remaining unresolved PC spans in comments: 0
- Remaining unsafe source expressions in comments: 3
- Explanatory comments moved to JSON report: 17
- Blank layout lines removed: 6
- Original routine declaration blockers: 0
- Routine declaration warnings in comments: 0
- Unknown compact 2C cells: 0 (0 directly referenced)
- Exact direct sites to unknown cells: 0
- Routines without located compact-cell geometry: 0
- Unknown compact cells without known frame offsets: 0
- WIP compact type choices: {}

## Unproved rendering methods used

- None.

The companion JSON lists every emitted unproved statement, remaining comment,
unknown-cell alternative, and original-PC local-reference site with code offset.
Source-safe here means accepted by the maintained renderer; it does not mean
the original source spelling or whole-PC equality has been recovered.
