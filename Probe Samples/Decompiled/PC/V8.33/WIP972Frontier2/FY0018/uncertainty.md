# FY0018 maximal KL uncertainty report

Original PC SHA-256: `c880c5eb8f7ad850cd9529195ca630d68d354e69fb5c7931610fd5b158d62f20`  
KL SHA-256: `2dc97fe34c8f36b7c0a8cf3ed6be3c9c59744e63c6c3d509e58736b554c30010`  
Strict source completeness: **no**.  
This KL is a reconstruction candidate. Compilation does not establish original behavior or deployment safety.

## Coverage

- Statements from existing source-safe renderer: 1
- Additional unproved statements emitted as code: 2 (66.67% of emitted statements)
- Existing-renderer statements with explicitly unproved rules: 2
- Guarded compact STRING concat source spellings (unproved original spelling): 0
- Remaining unresolved PC spans in comments: 1
- Remaining unsafe source expressions in comments: 1
- Explanatory comments moved to JSON report: 31
- Blank layout lines removed: 6
- Original routine declaration blockers: 1
- Routine declaration warnings in comments: 0
- Unknown compact 2C cells: 3 (1 directly referenced)
- Exact direct sites to unknown cells: 2
- Routines without located compact-cell geometry: 0
- Unknown compact cells without known frame offsets: 0
- WIP compact type choices: {'INTEGER': 1, 'REAL': 2}

## Unproved rendering methods used

- `bounded_typed_VECTOR_statement`: 2 statements

The companion JSON lists every emitted unproved statement, remaining comment,
unknown-cell alternative, and original-PC local-reference site with code offset.
Source-safe here means accepted by the maintained renderer; it does not mean
the original source spelling or whole-PC equality has been recovered.
