# CM0010 maximal KL uncertainty report

Original PC SHA-256: `74ee9141f86d1e1bff15784b257b2b9b2c62081f1edca08ea9aa83b005c40aff`  
KL SHA-256: `71baee2ebafa3d5948671bc88f3c2c235d03693baf29027ff8f1c61a83b365d1`  
Strict source completeness: **no**.  
This KL is a reconstruction candidate. Compilation does not establish original behavior or deployment safety.

## Coverage

- Statements from existing source-safe renderer: 2
- Additional unproved statements emitted as code: 1 (33.33% of emitted statements)
- Existing-renderer statements with explicitly unproved rules: 0
- Guarded compact STRING concat source spellings (unproved original spelling): 0
- Remaining unresolved PC spans in comments: 0
- Remaining unsafe source expressions in comments: 0
- Explanatory comments moved to JSON report: 16
- Blank layout lines removed: 5
- Original routine declaration blockers: 0
- Routine declaration warnings in comments: 0
- Unknown compact 2C cells: 0 (0 directly referenced)
- Exact direct sites to unknown cells: 0
- WIP compact type choices: {}

## Unproved rendering methods used

- `implicit_integer_real_assignment`: 1 statements

The companion JSON lists every emitted unproved statement, remaining comment,
unknown-cell alternative, and original-PC local-reference site with code offset.
Source-safe here means accepted by the maintained renderer; it does not mean
the original source spelling or whole-PC equality has been recovered.
