# FW0021 maximal KL uncertainty report

Original PC SHA-256: `e4a7dc653b5706c089bd0f7d894bc9e4c05c3ed024e1ea5eb5f6901808bc2c03`  
KL SHA-256: `7998b5240922e9f45a454546cc1fa52f837a68226f3f52a7d73e3daa74be3c89`  
Strict source completeness: **no**.  
This KL is a reconstruction candidate. Compilation does not establish original behavior or deployment safety.

## Coverage

- Statements from existing source-safe renderer: 2
- Additional unproved statements emitted as code: 3 (60.00% of emitted statements)
- Existing-renderer statements with explicitly unproved rules: 0
- Guarded compact STRING concat source spellings (unproved original spelling): 0
- Remaining unresolved PC spans in comments: 1
- Remaining unsafe source expressions in comments: 0
- Explanatory comments moved to JSON report: 30
- Blank layout lines removed: 6
- Original routine declaration blockers: 1
- Routine declaration warnings in comments: 0
- Unknown compact 2C cells: 5 (2 directly referenced)
- Exact direct sites to unknown cells: 4
- WIP compact type choices: {'BOOLEAN': 1, 'INTEGER': 1, 'REAL': 3}

## Unproved rendering methods used

- `assumed_compact_2c_source_type`: 3 statements

The companion JSON lists every emitted unproved statement, remaining comment,
unknown-cell alternative, and original-PC local-reference site with code offset.
Source-safe here means accepted by the maintained renderer; it does not mean
the original source spelling or whole-PC equality has been recovered.
