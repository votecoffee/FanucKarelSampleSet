# FW0005 maximal KL uncertainty report

Original PC SHA-256: `a969e8a65696f25719b9d1a79eb556f827d7f5be1a9665d3310506faf2b38da7`  
KL SHA-256: `ee46fef63db6be02d4cb348b165e603a15b542c2cb3f546f5ea51fe6f83e0c2d`  
Strict source completeness: **no**.  
This KL is a reconstruction candidate. Compilation does not establish original behavior or deployment safety.

## Coverage

- Statements from existing source-safe renderer: 5
- Additional unproved statements emitted as code: 2 (28.57% of emitted statements)
- Existing-renderer statements with explicitly unproved rules: 0
- Guarded compact STRING concat source spellings (unproved original spelling): 0
- Remaining unresolved PC spans in comments: 0
- Remaining unsafe source expressions in comments: 0
- Explanatory comments moved to JSON report: 31
- Blank layout lines removed: 6
- Original routine declaration blockers: 1
- Routine declaration warnings in comments: 0
- Unknown compact 2C cells: 4 (1 directly referenced)
- Exact direct sites to unknown cells: 2
- WIP compact type choices: {'BOOLEAN': 1, 'REAL': 3}

## Unproved rendering methods used

- `assumed_compact_2c_source_type`: 2 statements

The companion JSON lists every emitted unproved statement, remaining comment,
unknown-cell alternative, and original-PC local-reference site with code offset.
Source-safe here means accepted by the maintained renderer; it does not mean
the original source spelling or whole-PC equality has been recovered.
