# DX0045 maximal KL uncertainty report

Original PC SHA-256: `15bc6eeea79fc3c24fdb2a85478dab3fcce2f689f3e9b25e60e8b43d26392c71`  
KL SHA-256: `31f47fc002f5dc65ba7574d952e36b8aa19276bf61058dd3c28ed26ffdc2d353`  
Strict source completeness: **no**.  
This KL is a reconstruction candidate. Compilation does not establish original behavior or deployment safety.

## Coverage

- Statements from existing source-safe renderer: 1
- Additional unproved statements emitted as code: 5 (83.33% of emitted statements)
- Existing-renderer statements with explicitly unproved rules: 0
- Guarded compact STRING concat source spellings (unproved original spelling): 0
- Remaining unresolved PC spans in comments: 0
- Remaining unsafe source expressions in comments: 0
- Explanatory comments moved to JSON report: 20
- Blank layout lines removed: 5
- Original routine declaration blockers: 1
- Routine declaration warnings in comments: 0
- Unknown compact 2C cells: 2 (2 directly referenced)
- Exact direct sites to unknown cells: 5
- WIP compact type choices: {'INTEGER': 2}

## Unproved rendering methods used

- `assumed_compact_2c_source_type`: 5 statements

The companion JSON lists every emitted unproved statement, remaining comment,
unknown-cell alternative, and original-PC local-reference site with code offset.
Source-safe here means accepted by the maintained renderer; it does not mean
the original source spelling or whole-PC equality has been recovered.
