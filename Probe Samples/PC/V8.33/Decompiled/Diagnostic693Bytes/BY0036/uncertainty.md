# BYTEPROBE maximal KL uncertainty report

Original PC SHA-256: `73a26da3e172e6cd96c09f8b52089be3e0221776aef024f1ea8eff350045b4f2`  
KL SHA-256: `e84902bf6a41d9e0c0b74b49bfc7ca5fb64c2e26ffff7e3ef3f35225e43b0953`  
Strict source completeness: **no**.  
This KL is a reconstruction candidate. Compilation does not establish original behavior or deployment safety.

## Coverage

- Statements from existing source-safe renderer: 2
- Additional unproved statements emitted as code: 0 (0.00% of emitted statements)
- Existing-renderer statements with explicitly unproved rules: 0
- Guarded compact STRING concat source spellings (unproved original spelling): 0
- Remaining unresolved PC spans in comments: 0
- Remaining unsafe source expressions in comments: 0
- Explanatory comments moved to JSON report: 26
- Blank layout lines removed: 6
- Original routine declaration blockers: 1
- Routine declaration warnings in comments: 0
- Unknown compact 2C cells: 1 (0 directly referenced)
- Exact direct sites to unknown cells: 0
- WIP compact type choices: {'REAL': 1}

## Unproved rendering methods used

- None.

The companion JSON lists every emitted unproved statement, remaining comment,
unknown-cell alternative, and original-PC local-reference site with code offset.
Source-safe here means accepted by the maintained renderer; it does not mean
the original source spelling or whole-PC equality has been recovered.
